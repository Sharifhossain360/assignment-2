	<h1>What Is Shopify? </h1>
	<p>
		Shopify is a user-friendly e-commerce platform that helps small businesses build an online store and sell online through one streamlined dashboard. Shopify merchants can build a modern online store and sell on social media sites, seller marketplaces, other blogs and websites and via email, text and chat.

		In technical terms, <b class="color1">Shopify is a subscription-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) sales platform</b>. Shopify offers four standard store subscription plans with fees starting <mark>at $29 per month</mark>. All standard plans support a branded online store and a full array of in-person and online selling tools.
		</p>

		<p> <b class="color2">Shopify also offers a “Lite” plan for just $9 per month.</b> It doesn’t include an online store but supports mobile POS sales and a Buy Button for selling on other websites, blogs and via email.

All plans deliver a full suite of business management tools. Essentials, such as product sourcing, sales and inventory tracking, payment processing, shipping, customer accounts, marketing and reporting, are built into every Shopify plan. Plus, you can expand your Shopify toolkit easily with hundreds of Shopify Apps. </p>
